8. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

ans: initializing a repository means now git is creating the environment to provide version control on the given project.

9. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

ans: am guessing that staging area exists so that we can decide to commit some files first withouht touching the rest?

git init
git add
git status
staging area (using git add, before a commit)
working directory
git commit (prompting the text editor asking for description)
git commit -m "MESSAGE HERE" without using the prompting text editor

commit message style:

'''
Type (feature/fix/docs/style/refactor/test/chore): Subject
